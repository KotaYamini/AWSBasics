1. IAM refers to Identity & Access Management, Global Service
2. Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.
3. Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
4. Groups only contain users,not other groups.
5. Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.

IAM Permissions:
1. Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
2. These policies define the permissions of the users.
3. In AWS, you apply the least privilege principle: dont give morepermissions than a user needs.
