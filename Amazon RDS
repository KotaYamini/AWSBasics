# Amazon RDS Overview:

1. RDS stands for Relational Database Service.
2. It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
3. It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS.

- Postgres
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- IBM DB2
- Aurora (AWS Proprietary Database)

# Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

\*RDS is a managed service.

- Automated provisioning, OS patching.
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
- Monitoring dashboards
- Read replicas for improved read performance.
- Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery).
- Maintenance windows for upgrades.
- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal).
- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1).

\*But you can't SSH into your instances.

# RDS- Storage Auto Scaling

- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically.
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically.
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage.
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold(maximum limit for DB storage)
- Automatically modify storage if:
  1. Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage.
  2. Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes.
  3. 6 hours have passes since last modification.
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
- Supports all RDS database engines.

# RDS Read Replicas for read scalability:

1. Upto 15 Read Replicas.
2. Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region.
3. Replication is ASYNC so reads are eventually consistent.
4. Replicas can be promoted to their own DB.
5. Applications must update the connection string to levergae read replicas.

# RDS Read Replicas - Use Cases:

1. You have a production database that is taking on normal load.
2. You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics.
3. You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there.
4. The production application is unaffected.
5. Read replicas are used for SELECT(=read) only kind of statements. (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

# RDS Read Replicas - Network Cost

1. In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another.
2. For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee.
3. For RDS Read Replicas are in the cross region, you pay that fee.

# RDS Multi AZ(Disaster Recovery):

1. SYNC replication
2. One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby.
3. Increase availability.
4. Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network,instance or storage failure.
5. No manual intervention in apps.
6. Not used for scaling.
